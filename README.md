# Solidsport-Analytics-Tool
This Program is creates a powerpoint presentation for customers of the Solidsport Company containing all relevant analytical information of a specified event.

**In order to get the program to work the following dependencies have to be imported/installed:**
1. python 3.12.1 (I think it also works on older versions, I am not sure though)
2. The following packages have to be installed:
   1. pip install selenium
   2. pip install beautifulsoup4
   3. pip install python-pptx
   4. (maybe tkinter, if it isn't preinstalled)
3. **In order to navigate and access the files, as well as to create folders I am using the os tool, thus I don't think the code will work on windows yet** I will try to adapt the code accordingly asap. If you have a Mac this shouldn't raise any errors.
4. **When creating the presentation I am accessing a manually created powerpoint template (simple .pptx file). If this powerpoint doesn't exist on the desktop the program won't be able to create the Powerpoint** I will of course provide the template on here (or send it to you via WhatsApp) _p.s. It makes sense to look at the powerpoint Template, this will give you a good understanding of what Data I am trying to put in the powerpoint_

The **Chronological order** of the code:
1. Import of all relevant packages
2. Definition of all ChromeDriver functions
3. **Formating** and **calculation** functions for the data that will be processed
4. Functions for **accessing** the stored html file according to the specified data type and **extracting** the relevant info
5. **Powerpoint** table functions (I have a few rather complicated Tables that should also be formated neatly)
6. main()
   7. This functions 

The **functionalities** of the code:
